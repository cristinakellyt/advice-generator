## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SASS
- Flexbox
- Javascript
- Webpack

### Continued development

For this project I want to implement a feature to allow use to choose in which language the advice should be shown

### How to run in your machine

Open the command line in the project folder, and put the follow commands:

- npm install
- npm run dev (to the development mode)
- npm run build-app (to production mode)

If you don't have node in you PC, you'll have to install it. The first command will make the dowload of all packages that are needed for this project. in the other ones webpack will be used to compile and bundle the code to Javascript and CSS.
